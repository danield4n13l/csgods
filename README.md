My own, maintained Counter Strike: GO server with multiple gamemodes.

### My goals:
- Try to maintain a good practice server, with plugin support and minimal to no problems.
- Explore the CS:GO Servers' universe, and learn from it
- Learn SourcePawn language, which is a bit similar to C++ (or just plain C)

## What is in this repo?
Well, the whole server could not fully be uploaded onto GitHub's free storage space, so the only things that fit here are:
  - SourceMod and it's components
  - SM plugins and configurations
  - Map / Map prefix .cfg-s
  - Mapcycle generator script(s)
  - Gamemode-specific batch files (to start in *only* one mode)
